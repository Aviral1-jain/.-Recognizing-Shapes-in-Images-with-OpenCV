# Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV
In this 1.5 hour long project-based course, you will apply computer vision techniques to process images, extract useful features and detect shapes using Hough transforms
# Now we can process an image and detect shapes using OpenCV

 
1 - Load an image from file.

2 - Compute image gradients.

3 - Detect edges in an image.

4 - Recognize lines in an image using Hough transforms.

5 - Recognize circles in an image using Hough transforms.
